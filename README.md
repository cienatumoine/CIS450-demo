## Edge detection 
Edge detection focuses on pixel intensity and how it sharply changes. Gaussian blur is used to modify the image by smoothing it and limiting noise. Sobel operators detect changes in vertical and horizontal directions and Thresholding filters minor edges.
## Image Blending
Image blending merges two images into one result. The detected edges are layereed on the orginal image. In order for this to work, both images must share the same dimensions and color format.
